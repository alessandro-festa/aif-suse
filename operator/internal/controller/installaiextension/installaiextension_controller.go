// onto the top-level Ready condition, then marks the phase Failed. Mirroring
// keeps Ready from showing a stale success while phase is Failed (a
// pull/deployment/Rancher failure otherwise updated only its own
// sub-condition). Sites that already set Ready directly do not need this.
//
// The requeue is the point, and it is why this is no longer called
// setTerminalFailure. Every caller is a failure with a cause outside the CR — a
// registry that was unreachable, Rancher CRDs not installed yet, a rollout that
// overran its bound. None of those produce an event when they clear, because
// the controller watches InstallAIExtension and nothing else, so a zero Result
// meant the CR stayed Failed until someone edited it or the informer resynced
// (~10h). Phase stays Failed and the conditions still say what went wrong; the
// CR is simply looked at again.
//
// healthCheckInterval is the floor, deliberately: a failed CR is re-examined no
// faster than a healthy one. It is also six times gentler than the
// readinessRequeue loop that already re-enters EnsureRelease while waiting, so
// the first retry adds no pull rate the operator did not already sustain.
//
// It is only the floor because the interval is flat but the wait is not bounded,
// and those two together are the problem. Nothing here gives up: a CR pointing at
// a registry that is never coming back retries at the same rate for as long as
// the operator runs, which is ~1,440 attempts a day, each one a real pull.
// Private charts make that concrete — chartCacheKey declines to cache a spec
// carrying credentials, precisely so a hit cannot skip the authentication a fetch
// would have performed, so every one of those attempts is an authenticated round
// trip to someone else's registry. A minute is a reasonable thing to do once and
// an unreasonable thing to do forever at a fixed rate.
//
// So the interval grows with how long the CR has already been failing, clamped
// into [healthCheckInterval, maxFailureRetryInterval]: 60s, 60s, 120s, 240s,
// 480s, then 900s from there on. The elapsed time comes from Ready's
// LastTransitionTime rather than a counter in status, because
// meta.SetStatusCondition only moves that stamp when the status *changes*. A CR
// that stays False keeps its original stamp and the interval widens; one that
// recovers and fails again gets a fresh stamp and starts over at the floor. That
// is the behaviour a counter would have to be written, persisted and reset by
// hand to reproduce, and it survives an operator restart or a leader change for
// free, which an in-memory map would not.
//
// Read after the conditions are set, not before: on the first failure Ready has
// just been stamped now, so elapsed is ~0 and the clamp returns the floor.
//
// Failures that are *not* routed through here are the ones a retry cannot
// change: an unsupported source kind, a malformed chart URL, a host the
// allowlist rejects. Those are a pure function of the spec and the operator's
// own flags, and a change to either already wakes the controller — through the
// watch for a CR edit, through the restart for a flag. Requeuing them would
// re-derive an identical answer every minute forever.
