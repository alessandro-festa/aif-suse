// StatefulSetRolloutIncomplete names why a StatefulSet has not finished rolling
// out the revision currently in its spec, or returns "" once it has. It is the
// StatefulSet analogue of RolloutIncomplete (see deployment.go) and exists for
// the same reason: counting ready pods alone reports a RollingUpdate as done
// while the previous revision's pods are still serving, so a broken upgrade
// would look healthy. It follows `kubectl rollout status`' StatefulSet logic
// (kubectl/pkg/polymorphichelpers/rollout_status.go).
//
// The generation check mirrors RolloutIncomplete's (ObservedGeneration <
// Generation) rather than kubectl's extra ObservedGeneration == 0 clause, so the
// two sibling helpers reason about a stale spec identically.
//
// Two update strategies are handled the way kubectl does. A partitioned
// RollingUpdate only rolls pods with an ordinal at or above the partition, so
// UpdateRevision never converges to CurrentRevision and a naive revision compare
// would report such a StatefulSet as forever rolling; it is complete once the
// pods above the partition carry the new revision. An OnDelete StatefulSet is not
// updated by the controller at all (pods roll only when deleted by hand), so
// there is no rollout to track and the ready-replica check alone decides it.
