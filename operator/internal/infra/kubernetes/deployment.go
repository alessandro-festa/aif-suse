// rolloutIncomplete names why a Deployment has not finished rolling out the

//
// This answers "is the version I just applied serving?", not "are some pods
// up?" — the distinction is the whole point. The Helm upgrade no longer waits
// for readiness itself (see helm.newUpgradeAction), so this is the only check
// between applying a manifest and the CR reporting Installed. Counting ready
// pods alone cannot make that call: the extension chart rolls at one replica
// with maxUnavailable 25%, which rounds down to zero, so the *previous*
// revision's pod stays Ready for the entire rollout and keeps the count at its
// desired value from the first moment to the last.
//
// The four conditions are `kubectl rollout status`' own, in its order
// (kubectl/pkg/polymorphichelpers/rollout_status.go), because that is the
// definition every operator already reasons about — and reaching for a
// different one here would mean this function and `kubectl rollout status`
// could disagree about the same Deployment.
//
// One of kubectl's is missing, so they can still disagree. Ahead of the four,
// kubectl reads the Progressing condition and fails outright on
// ProgressDeadlineExceeded; this only ever answers "not yet", so a rollout the
// deployment controller has already given up on is waited out here until
// DefaultReadinessTimeout rather than reported as the failure it is. Both end
// in a retryable failure, so the difference is how long a wedged rollout takes
// to surface, not whether it does — closing it is its own change.
